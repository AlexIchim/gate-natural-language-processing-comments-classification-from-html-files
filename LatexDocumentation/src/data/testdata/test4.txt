<title>Amazon.co.uk:Customer Reviews: Kindle Paperwhite, 6&#034; High Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers</title>

<span class="a-size-base review-text">An open complaint to Amazon:<br /><br />I'm really annoyed at the lifespan of kindles. My last 2 kindles have died just short of 2 years into use (a kindle KB and a Kindle Paperwhite).  My last paperwhite died last night after nearly 2 years(through no fault of my own, i was just reading it, didn't do anything to it!) BUT, I phone customer support and as much as the device is locked, says &#34;your kindle needs repair&#34; all customer services will do is offer me a replacement.  They can't even tell me what the error code on the kindle means, so i can get it repaired....bad service amazon.<br /><br />A £100 replacement every 2 years is ridiculous (renting a device for a fiver a month, do I then feel the discount on the books i buy?) , but i feel bought into the eco-system now, so to walk away would lose me all the books i've bought over the last few years.  But i think that the books are portable, so will now be looking at alternatives.<br /><br />Mine was one of the 5th gen kindle's without the ad's(as before this generation I didn't have to pay for an ad supported version), I also feel aggrieved that I'm spending £100 on a device that lasts me 2 years and buying all my books from them then have to pay extra to get the ads removed. I'm currently looking for an alternative e-reader that may last me a little longer.<br /><br />Oh, but amazon are nice, they will offer you a factory refurb model of the one I have at a lesser price (Because it's refurbed and out of date, does that warrant the discount?), because they can't tell me what's wrong with mine.....thanks amazon.<br /><br />I'm sending this to customer services too, just so that it's seen by them too.</span></div><div id="R2S441D3XG64HQ_imageSection_main" class="a-section a-spacing-medium a-spacing-top-medium review-image-container"><div class="review-image-tile-section">

		<span class="a-size-base review-text">I've just had to order my third replacement for the same issue, bright white dead pixels on the screen (much brighter than other white parts). Makes reading in the dark really distracting and unpleasamt. Kind of defeats the point of a backlit Kindle.<br /><br />Really unhappy to see such poor quality in an Amazon product like this. Will expect a refund if the new one ends up just as bad.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments"><div data-reftag="cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn" aria-live="polite" data-a-expander-name="review_comment_expander" class="a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" data-action="a-expander-toggle" class="a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-inline-header a-link-expander" data-a-expander-toggle="{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><i class="a-icon a-icon-expand"></i><span class="a-expander-prompt"><span class="review-comment-total aok-hidden">2</span><span class="a-size-base">2 comments</span></span></a><span class="a-letter-space"></span><i class="a-icon a-icon-text-separator" aria-label="|"><span class="a-icon-alt">|</span></i><span class="a-letter-space"></span><span class="a-size-base cr-vote"><span class="cr-vote-buttons"><span class="a-color-secondary"><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary review-votes">42 people found this helpful</span><span>. </span>Was this review helpful to you?</span><span class="a-letter-space"></span><span class="a-button a-button-beside-text a-button-small cr-vote-button cr-vote-yes"><span class="a-button-inner"><a
		
		
		class="a-size-base review-text">Amazon will bombard you with &#34;special offers&#34; if you buy this kindle. I have bought 9 kindles over the years as gifts for family and I want to throw this one in the bin. The special offers it recommends are likely only to be enjoyed by a middle aged sexually frustrated Barbara Cartland fan. You can pay an extra £10 to have the offers removed (I discovered after contacting the Helpdesk), which frankly is a rip off given that the Kindle costs more than any of its predecessors.<br />A sly marketing tool by Amazon to flog books written by Unknown authors.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments"><div data-reftag="cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn" aria-live="polite" data-a-expander-name="review_comment_expander" class="a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" data-action="a-expander-toggle" class="a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-inline-header a-link-expander" data-a-expander-toggle="{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><i class="a-icon a-icon-expand"></i><span class="a-expander-prompt"><span class="review-comment-total aok-hidden">5</span><span class="a-size-base">5 comments</span></span></a><span class="a-letter-space"></span><i class="a-icon a-icon-text-separator" aria-label="|"><span class="a-icon-alt">|</span></i><span class="a-letter-space"></span><span class="a-size-base cr-vote"><span class="cr-vote-buttons"><span class="a-color-secondary"><span class="a-size-small a-color-secondary review-votes">87 people found this helpful</span><span>. </span>Was this review helpful to you?</span><span class="a-letter-space"></span><span class="a-button a-button-beside-text a
		
		
		class="a-size-base review-text">I bought my husband a kindle paperwhite for Christmas 2014 and he was pleased with it, however he is not an avid reader and consequently the unit isn't turned on regularly. Yesterday 20 /03/2016 he attempted to open the kindle to read a recent download and found the screen was frozen..he contacted Amazon only to be told that it was 5 months out of warranty!!!! After explaining that he felt that it should last longer than 17 months he was told that it was probably his fault because it wasnt turned on regularly for it to update!!!! Where I appreciate the 12 month warranty issue I cannot see anywhere instructions to inform owners to turn the unit on regularly...He has been offered a 15% discount on a new unit by Amazon Customer Care.. Sounds like a good deal for Amazon but a poor deal for the customer to me..surely if Amazon are promoting this as a good buy they should at least offer a repair service..we can't all afford to replace things on a yearly basis.. I feel very disappointed with the reasons given for the unit failure and feel that a replacement would have been the best solution. BUYER BEWARE!!!</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments"><div data-reftag="cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn" aria-live="polite" data-a-expander-name="review_comment_expander" class="a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" data-action="a-expand
