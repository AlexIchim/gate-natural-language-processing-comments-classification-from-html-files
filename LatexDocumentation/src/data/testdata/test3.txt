<title>Amazon.co.uk:Customer Reviews: Kindle Paperwhite, 6&#034; High Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers</title>

 review-text">Amazon will bombard you with &#34;special offers&#34; if you buy this kindle. I have bought 9 kindles over the years as gifts for family and I want to throw this one in the bin. The special offers it recommends are likely only to be enjoyed by a middle aged sexually frustrated Barbara Cartland fan. You can pay an extra £10 to have the offers removed (I discovered after contacting the Helpdesk), which frankly is a rip off given that the Kindle costs more than any of its predecessors.<br />A sly marketing tool by Amazon to flog books written by Unknown authors.</spa

e review-text">I've just had to order my third replacement for the same issue, bright white dead pixels on the screen (much brighter than other white parts). Makes reading in the dark really distracting and unpleasamt. Kind of defeats the point of a backlit Kindle.<br /><br />Really unhappy to see such poor quality in an Amazon product like this. Will expect a refund if the new one ends up just as bad.</span></div><div

My last 2 kindles have died just short of 2 years into use (a kindle KB and a Kindle Paperwhite).  My last paperwhite died last night after nearly 2 years(through no fault of my own, i was just reading it, didn't do anything to it!) BUT, I phone customer support and as much as the device is locked, says &#34;your kindle needs repair&#34; all customer services will do is offer me a replacement.  They can't even tell me what the error code on the kindle means, so i can get it repaired....bad service amazon.<br /><br />A £100 replacement every 2 years is ridiculous (renting a device for a fiver a month, do I then feel the discount on the books i buy?) , but i feel bought into the eco-system now, so to walk away would lose me all the books i've bought over the last few years.  But i think that the books are portable, so will now be looking at alternatives.<br /><br />Mine was one of the 5th gen kindle's without the ad's(as before this generation I didn't have to pay for an ad supported version), I also feel aggrieved that I'm spending £100 on a device that lasts me 2 years and buying all my books from them then have to pay extra to get the ads removed. I'm currently looking for an alternative e-reader that may last me a little longer.<br /><br />Oh, but amazon are nice, they will offer you a factory refurb model of the one I have at a lesser price (Because it's refurbed and out of date, does that warrant the discount?), because they can't tell me what's wrong with mine.....thanks amazon.<br /><br />I'm sending this to customer services too, just so that it's seen by them too.</span></div><div id="R2S441D3XG64HQ_imageSection_main" class="a-section a-spacing-medium a-spacing-top-medium review-image-container"><div class="review-image-tile-section">
