 ><span class="a-size-base review-text">I've been an Amazon Prime member for over 10 years where my wife an I have purchased countless products.  We have an amazon delivery waiting on our porch more often than not.  But I've never been a big reviewer.  A product has to really wow me or be terrible for me to review something.  I will say that that the 7&#34; Fire Tablet fits into the first category for me.  I keep having to remind myself that this is a $50 device.  It is quite fast and easy to use.  I have owned a multitude of iOS and Windows products.  I currently have an iPad Air, Surface Pro 4, iPad mini 1, iPad 3, iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, two apple TVs, a Fire TV, a roku, two mac book pros, and a Lenovo idea stick. I decided to dust my iPad mini 1 off recently for the sole purpose of reading the Washington Post (6 months free, then low monthly rate with Amazon Prime, thanks Jeff Bezos!), Flipboard, and Team Stream from Bleacher Report.  You get the idea, I was going to deal with 4 year old HW just for reading.  The screen was cracked so I went on Amazon to buy a new screen/digitizer.  Once I made that purchase, I noticed the $50 tablet.  I've known about the cheap Fire tablet for a while, but never felt the need to buy one.  But what the heck, I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />To my surprise, this Fire Tablet dominates over the fixed iPad Mini 1.  It is a bit thicker and heavier, screen resolution is good, not great and the screen aspect ratio takes some getting used to, but aside from that, this $50 tablet is quite superior to the iPad Mini 1.  This tablet is fast and fun to use.  It has a microsSD slot so my 8GB tablet got turned into a 64GB tablet with a $16 Patriot 64GB MicroSD card.  I would recommend installing the MicroSD card prior to downloading apps because it's kind of a pain to move all your apps to the SD card afterwards.<br /><br />In addition to the uses I mentioned above, Access to Amazon Underground allows me to install a boatload of apps for my son and me.  I even got really excited about Freetime unlimited, but then realized that in-app purchases weren't allowed in Freetime, so I quickly abandoned that until Amazon fixes it (Fix it please Mr. Bezos). I also installed Hulu, Netflix, Watch ESPN, WatchABC, HBO go, and of course I have Amazon Video preinstalled.  All work flawlessly.  AND Amazon finally gives us a UI option that doesn't include that stupid Carousel so all is good in the world. I'm about to be issued an iPad Air 2 for work and I can honestly say, that I may end up using this tablet more than the iPad.<br /><br />Anyway, if you have any doubts about trying this tablet out, let me put them to rest right now.  BUY THIS TABLET.  You can always return it if it doesn't work out for you, but I can't imagine that you'll be doing that.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments"><div data-reftag="cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn" aria-live="polite" data-a-expander-name="review_comment_expander" class="a-row a-expander-container a-expander-inline-container"><a href="javascript:void(0)" data-action="a-expander-toggle" class="a-expander-header a-declarative a-expander-inline-header a-link-expander" data-a-expander-toggle="{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><i class="a-icon a-icon-expand"></i><span class="a-expander-prompt"><

 <span class="a-size-base review-text">Lasted six months removing the good value of the kindle. There's only a ninety day warrantee instead of the year that we were used to. Ok, I should have read the fine print. Getting the regular year warrantee costs extra. Very disappointed in the product and what had been to this point good customer service.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments"><div data-reftag="cm_cr_arp_d_cmt_opn" aria-li
