<title>Amazon.com: Customer Reviews: TP-LINK AC1200 Wireless Dual-Band Wi-Fi Router, 5GHz 867Mbps + 2.4GHz 300Mbps (Archer C50)</title>

<span class="a-size-base review-text">I haven't had this long enough to have to call for assistance or repair, but compared to my old router this thing is amazing. My home is 1600sf - the router is on one end of the home and I get three bars on my phone wherever I am. With my old Netgear I had no wireless connection at all when on the other end of the house. Setup was simple.</span></div><div


<span class="a-size-base review-text">So far so good.  Bought this to replace an old dlink router who keeps dropping connection.  It was an easy install.  User Interface for setting up the router was very easy to follow.  So far no connection drops from time of install.  If this product can maintain no connection drops, then it is a solid 5 stars, only time will tell but for now keeping this at 5.<br /><br />P.S. Main difference between this C50 vs C5 is the Ethernet port.  This only has Fast Ethernet which is 100Mbps.  C5 has Gigabit Ethernet which is 1GB up.  100Mbps is plenty fast depending on what you want to do.  I opted for this because we never use the wired connection anyway and we only have less than 100Mbps internet speed anyway.  Good that TP link offers variety of product to fit user needs.  Be sure specs is what is right for you before purchasing.</span>


<span class="a-size-base review-text">I was a little concerned after ordering when I noticed that all the 5 stars were from people who got free routers for their reviews. I started to worry that these reviews did not accurately portray the pros and cons of said device. Luckily, the router works flawlessly. After about an hour of it up and running for the first time (stuttered for the first 30 min on), it ran 100% stable and very fast.<br /><br />I was replacing a Linksys E2000, and I was happy to find that the range of the AC1200 was a bit better, and the connection stronger. I live in a 4 bedroom, average sized suburban home with 3 floors, and we get full bars and great speeds at all corners. I am surprised and happy with this purchase. It's so intuitive and wonderful. Would recommend to anyone! I can't imagine needing one of their higher models in a standard sized home with 4 or so people using it.</span>


<span class="a-size-base review-text">Note: I paid full price for this router, happily. I'm not one of the other reviewers of this product who got it free or discounted.<br /><br />I bought this because I also own the Archer C7 and have been very pleased with it. The tether app for iOS is lacking, for both routers, however I don't need/want that app anyways. Accessing the config panel via browser on mobile could be safer too, presuming you use port 443 and a self-signed TLS certificate.<br /><br />Great range, great isolation on guest networks, and as a bonus it handles IGMP snooping so you don't necessarily need a switch inbetween it and modem for simple small home setups. Heck, most people don't even have hardware that does so and don't realize what they are missing out on in today's world of overly-used multicast protocols like Bonjour that can cause a lot of network noise and irritate your application layer firewalls.<br /><br />I recommend TP-Link routers, switches, and anything else they make for networking. 10x better than a d-link product, anyday (in my opinion).</span>


<span class="a-size-base review-text">Updated Warning - This router may not work with some Amazon Fire tablets.  I bought this router because a new Toshiba laptop was having trouble staying connected to my old router.  The new router fixed the problem, plus it's much faster than my old router (1 year old TP-Link WR-841n).  It also has IPv6 which the old router did not.  So far the 5ghz band has not been used since none of my devices can use this.<br /><br />Hookup and startup of the router was very easy - no problems.<br /><br />All the connected devices (including Kindle Paperwhite and an old Amazon Fire) worked OK except for my Amazon Fire HD 7 (4th Generation) tablet.  This tablet connects OK, but the connection gets 'stuck' after 3 or 4 pages of (slow) Internet activity.  Turning off / on the Fire wireless fixes it for another few pages.  I spent about 2 hours on the phone with Amazon support and completely reset the tablet, no improvement.  It's been elevated to Amazon's communication specialists, have not heard from them yet (7 days).  I tried adjusting all the router options, but none fixed it.  I have been going back and forth with TP-Link via e-mail, they have been responsive, so far.  Tried all their suggestions and tests, they have now elevated to their senior engineers.  I will update if anything changes.<br /><br />Now that I am a semi expert in routers, I went back to my old WR841N and updated the firmware and defaulted the settings and it now works OK with all my devices, so that's what I am using.  The WR841N is not as fast as the C50.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments">


review-text">With an ether cable attached I was getting 127 Mbps download. That I confirmed before the Charter person left the house. But we had a bad experience with a TP-LINK router which I we'll send back to Amazon. TP-LINK support really couldn’t help. They just suggested changing channels. But the connectivity was always flaky.<br /><br />With the TP-LINK I was getting max speeds of 30-40 Mbps over wi-fi when it worked. But we were experiencing multiple Internet no-response freezes per day on all devices - computers, iPhones - even when standing next to the TPC-LINK. So it wasn’t a range problem. The router is just unstable.<br /><br />So we switched to a Netgear AC1200 router yesterday and it's been stable since then. Wi-fi speeds are better too - usually 80 Mbps - 130 Mbps depending on when I test with speedtest. Sometimes, but not often,  it’s as low as 30 Mbps. As I'm posting this, I'm getting about 120 Mbps on my Mac, over wi-fi, from the basement (the Netgear router is on the ground floor).</span>
