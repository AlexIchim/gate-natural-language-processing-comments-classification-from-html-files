<span class="a-size-base review-text">Overall, a great improvement over my Kindle Touch.  The resolution is better and it's much faster in transitioning between various screens and pages of books.  Renders pictures much more clearly.<br /><br />However, I think Amazon goofed hugely in not giving the Paperwhite the ability to play audio.  I think Amazon needs to bring back that capability as it added tremendously to the product and it's functionality.  It may have reduced space, or made the Kindle heavier or a little slower, but I think the overall value of the ability to play audio files more than made up for that.</span></div><div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments">
